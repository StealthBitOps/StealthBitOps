### Start Here: Lucie’s Cybersecurity Wiki

Welcome! This repo is just the doorway, the real action happens in the [Wiki](https://github.com/StealthBitOps/StealthBitOps/wiki).

Whether you're a **recruiter** curious about my pivot from clinical tech to cybersecurity, or a fellow **career shifter** navigating your own path, the Wiki is where I document:

- 🧪 Labs and walkthroughs from platforms like TryHackMe and VulnHub  
- 🧠 Notes on cybersecurity concepts and tools  
- 🏅 Milestones from my learning journey  

It’s part sandbox, part showcase, and 100% hands-on.

Thanks for stopping by, dive into the [Wiki](https://github.com/StealthBitOps/StealthBitOps/wiki) and explore what I’ve been building.
